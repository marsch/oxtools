It allows the user to create her\/his JPA business model with a few clicks and view, store and edit its diagram.\r\n\r\nIn the 21-st century the computers' capabilities are great enough to justify the users' complaints about the lack of a smooth graphical UI. What this means in the JPA world? Imagine that you have to review a business data model consisting of 10-15 JPA entities, which have been implemented by someone else. You have to review the attributes and annotations of every single entity. If you don't have a diagram, you'll want to draw one - even on a piece of paper. Now, imagine that your model contains 50-100 entities! Imagine that you have to implement them, not only review them! What a comfort would it be to easily, with just of a few clicks, to create a visually accessible diagram of your model!\r\n\r\nThe JPA Diagram Editor allows the user to easily create, view, and edit a model with the graphical means of the Graphiti. Creating new entities, attributes, and relations is achievable with a few clicks only. Does the relation owner attribute had to have the 'mappedBy' property or was it the inverse attribute? Who cares! Just pull the string from the owner to the inverse. You can create a diagram from existing model, just like this. We are convinced that JPA developers, which use the Eclipse IDE, need such a tool, and they will love it. Developing applications with JPA has never been that easy and pleasant, and the result is a nice clean diagram, instead of (just) complex Java code. Until now, there was no JPA diagram tool in the open source Eclipse IDE. Let's talk about the first one! \r\n\r\nInitially, the JPA Diagram Editor project has been contributed in the WTP Incubator Project. Later on, it became part of Eclipse JPT Dali and recently it was released with Indigo.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy: Those of you who have attended this talk at ESE 2010 or EclipseCon 2011 (Santa Clara) should attend it now again and see the demo of the significantly extended JPA Diagram Editor with support for JPA 2.0! \r\n\r\nFor information where you can find the source of the JPA Diagram Editor, please visit the project wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/wiki.eclipse.org\/JPA_Diagram_Editor_Project\r\n\r\nYou can see a short demo here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xZf6pOHX178\r\n",

			"title" : "Dynamic Projects and Minimalistic Workspace Setup in Enterprise Environment",
			"abstract" : "Abstract:  We will describe our journey into setting up minimalistic development environment at eBay.  Developers tend to include many source projects in their workspaces because they may potentially need to view, debug or otherwise tinker with included source.  While viewing and debugging are possible with precompiled project libraries (jars), they don\u2019t allow one to make modifications. \r\n\r\nWe describe dynamic projects as a way to bridge this gap by allowing developers to include projects in their binary form with an option to convert them to source projects!  Like PDE but with regular JDT projects.   This can be taken a step further by including only the source files being modified while having the rest of them come from their binary form.  This is done by manipulating classpath which can elegantly be handled using custom classpath container.\r\n\r\nWith the dynamic projects, as much of the code is brought as binary, we run the risk of not caching the compilation issues due to source changes that affect their dependent binaries.  We describe technique used to detect such binary compatibility breakage that would have gotten caught if those elements where coming as source. \r\n\r\nDevelopers tend to import or create all the source projects they need before hand and compile and build everything even if they don\u2019t edit it. There is a reason why they do that. They want to see the source, put break points, run individually, basically they want to play around with it a little bit.. This is exactly what dynamic projects enable them with i.e.   cater all the facilities of a source project without the overhead of compilation. As we all know nothing comes for free, we need to build the binary and source jars for these projects and keep them available for using it in the dynamic project. Once the developers decides to edit a file, that\u2019s when we provision the source as real source and compile it.\r\n\r\nLet us take it to the next level, Till now we treated the whole project or a jar as a single unit. Why even that? How about we convert only the single file you want to edit. Amazing huh??. That\u2019s what really makes the dynamic projects big. Here we let the developer modify just the files he wants to edit, and the rest of the code comes as binary from the jar files. The whole classpath complexity associated with the above two use cases is being handled inside of a custom classpath container.\r\n\r\nLet us try to make it a little more interesting by detecting binary compatibility in this scenario. One of the biggest problems with libraries especially utility libraries is that changes to the API might break the binary compatibility. Earlier, this type of errors were be detected by compiling the consumer source code and if the consumers are binaries. In the worst case if consumers are not recompiled against the changed API,, then these errors will be manifested as run time errors there by breaking the production. Here we are addressing this issue, by detecting the binary compatibility breakage inside of the jars on the fly. Basically as and when user edits it, we signal the user if he breaks an existing consumer with his change. ",

It is a revised version of the tutorial from EclipseCon 2011, where we show how to build a very simple data-centric application, including the UI, based on EMF. We explain how to define a model in EMF and generate code from it. We explore the API of the generated code, that is, how to create, navigate and modify model instances. Then we demonstrate how to build a UI based on this model using databinding. For our example we build an application to manage a conference, including authors and submissions.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the tutorial, there is a brief overview of the most important add-on technologies for EMF.  Here you have the opportunity to learn what different frameworks are available and which technologies you might investigate in more detail. Part 2 is organized in the Ignite format. There are 9 talks, 5 minutes each, given by committers on the various projects. The projects we cover are: EMF Compare, GMF, EEF, EMF Client Platform, Teneo, CDO, EMFStore, EMF Query 2 and EDAPT. Remember, we won\u2019t go into detail here, but you should come away with an understanding of what you can gain by using these technologies.\r\n\r\nThis is our schedule for the tutorial including the speakers that have confirmed their participation:\r\n\r\n- EMF Modeling including UI (2 hours)\r\n- Ignite Talks (1 hour):\r\n- EMF Compare (Cedric Brun)\r\n- GMF (Mariot Chauvin)\r\n- EEF (Mariot Chauvin)\r\n- EMF Client Platform (NItesh Narayan)\r\n- CDO (Eike Stepper)\r\n- Teneo (Martin Taal)\r\n- EMF Query 2 (Saurav Sarkar)\r\n- EMFStore (Otto von Wesendonk & Edgar Mueller)\r\n- EDAPT (Markus Herrmannsdoerfer)\r\n- EMF Texo (Martin Taal)\r\n\r\nPlease find all contents of the tutorial in these two blog posts (including slides): \r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/eclipsesource.com\/blogs\/2011\/03\/22\/what-every-eclipse-developer-should-know-about-emf-part-1\/\">Blog Post 1<\/a>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/eclipsesource.com\/blogs\/2011\/03\/31\/what-every-eclipse-developer-should-know-about-emf-%e2%80%93-part-2\/\">Blog Post 2<\/a>\r\n\r\nSlides:\r\n<div style=\"width:425px\" id=\"__ss_7532861\"> <strong style=\"display:block;margin:12px 0 4px\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/JonasHelming\/what-every-eclipse-developer-should-know-about-emf-tutorial-at-eclipsecon\" title=\"What every Eclipse developer should know about EMF - Tutorial at EclipseCon\">What every Eclipse developer should know about EMF - Tutorial at EclipseCon<\/a><\/strong> <iframe src=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/7532861\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe> <div style=\"padding:5px 0 12px\"> View more <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/\">presentations<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/JonasHelming\">JonasHelming<\/a> <\/div> <\/div>",

Then I am going to demonstrate a new generic graphical view framework.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThis framework that is configured using two Xtext 2.0 based DSLs: One for defining the mapping and the other for styling the graphical elements.

By automating these tests though, we can gain valuable feedback about the quality of the application from the customer perspective as often as we need it, giving us the chance to adapt and fix to make things better.\r\n\r\nThe success of automating acceptance tests through the GUI is dependent on their ability to be flexible and robust. It\u2019s also an advantage if they can be written early (even before the application is available) and by the whole team (not just by members who are expert programmers). \r\n\r\nThis tutorial introduces participants to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/jubula>Jubula<\/a> project with hands-on exercises. The Jubula project is aimed at testers who want to automate their black-box tests for Swing, SWT\/RCP and GEF applications. The keyword-driven approach lets testers design, automate and maintain tests by dragging and dropping from a library of test actions. Test creation is quick and code-free, tests are easy to read, and the modular structure makes them easy to maintain (despite changes in the application\u2019s GUI). \r\n\r\nThis tutorial is aimed at testers, developers and test managers who are interested in functionally testing their applications. We\u2019ll cover test creation, execution and analysis with Jubula for an example Eclipse application and talk about test design for flexibility and maintenance. \r\n\r\nParticipants should come with a laptop where Jubula is already installed. \r\n\r\n<strong>Jubula tutorial at EclipseCon 2011<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAn <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipsecon.org\/2011\/sessions\/sessions?id=2031\">earlier version<\/a> of this tutorial was given at EclipseCon 2011.

Going a notch further, certain relationships can be presented with one or more diagrams on separate pages.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, building such multi-page editor using basic Eclipse platform facilities is a daunting challenge. It can take many months to create something half-decent for even smaller schemas.

Generics are intended to develop type-safe general algorithms of processing collections (lists, stacks, trees, etc.) non-dependent (or dependent in some limited, explicitly specified ways) on collection element types. To our knowledge, generics (formerly named \"parametrized types\", \"modals\", \"tempates\", etc.) first appeared in CLU in 1974 and were invented by Professor Barbara Liskov from MIT. The term \"generics\" was coined by the authors of Ada (in late 1970s). Since that time, generics have experienced great evolution in a variety of languages (CLU, ALPHARD, Ada, C++, Java, C#, F#, Visual Prolog, etc.). The talk covers generics features and their specifics in many languages, specifics of their semantics and implementation, the approach to generics in Java, its advangates and shortcomings, a proposal to add new generics features to Java.

There were constraints, such as hybrid (<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Keyword-driven_testing\">keyword<\/a>-<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Data-driven_testing\">data<\/a>) driven methodology support, robustness to successfully deal with a large number of test cases and vast amount of test data, an above all, user-friendliness to software testers who are not experienced programmers. Also, the testing process required all test cases to be managed by test case management tool <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teamst.org\/\">TestLink<\/a> and executed, on a daily basis, by continuous integration tool <a href=\"http:\/\/hudson-ci.org\/\">Hudson<\/a>. \r\nAfter the intense Internet search, knowledge and experience exchange with colleagues and partnering companies, a non-expected solution emerged \u2013 Eclipse, a tool not intended to be used by software testers in their everyday work. Also, it was decided to use automated testing framework for web applications \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/seleniumhq.org\/\">Selenium<\/a> and test framework \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/testng.org\">TestNG<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Solving the puzzle<\/strong>\r\nThe main challenge of introducing the testers to Eclipse was the language. To support the difference of conception of Java language abstract concepts between testers and programmers, simplified language was introduced - <em><strong>\u201cJava for Testers\u201d<\/strong><\/em>. This language contains only the basic elements of Java and is simple, yet powerful enough to allow testers to easily write and read automated test cases. \r\nAfter the first step was taken, the problem of creating a link between automated tests and results of its execution to custom made open source test management tool TestLink was solved. With test framework TestNG modifications we were close to the solution.\r\nA custom tool was developed that will extract useful information from automated tests and create files that are readable by TestLink. This tool allowed the testers to maintain traceability between requirements, automated test cases and results of execution.\r\n\r\nComplexity of the system under test required building new tools, modifying existing ones, challenging and improving software development life-cycle process.\r\nEclipse provided the testers with great support in their task. Content assist, refactoring support, code completion and other features helped the testers to work efficiently, while concentrating on the goal rather than on the tool. \r\nStill, implementation of the described solution is a work in progress. Many ideas for improvement are added to road map. Which ones? You can check out if you visit this session.",

			"abstract" : "This talk is providing an overview of how one can enable collaborative modeling using the Eclipse Technologies, what kind of solutions are existing right now, how to integrate with SCM systems, what works and what is. All this information for free, based on our experience. \r\n\r\nMany missing pieces are being developed for Juno and are opening a whole new world of possibilities. From the Mylyn task focused UI integrated with EMF to the Dawn 2.0 project providing live collaboration and the evolutions of EMF Compare, great Eclipse Juno technologies are going to be demoed.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThese last five years have seen the generalization of model usage, as their adequation to the design of complex systems began to be more and more understood, and researched. Modeling using specifically tailored models is now common practice. Modeling tools, especially in Eclipse, matured a lot and they are fit for a lot of different contexts and requirements; from the French unemployment office to the NASA. This rising success is not complete yet though, and collaborative modeling is barely taking off, holding back wider adoption.\r\n\r\nLet's go back all the way to 2006. At that time, during the Eclipse Summit Europe conference, the community at large voices its concerns : there is no available open-source component aiming at comparing and merging models; while such a tool is critical to the success of all modeling-related technologies. Models were becoming more and more central in the development process, their importance rising to the level of the source code's... and yet there was no tool designed to allow teams to work on models collaboratively. It is in light of this observation that we decided to start the EMF Compare project.\r\n\r\nThe challenges were then to be able to compare any kind of model, be it specific or based on a standard, with a good scalability and accuracy of the matching algorithms; and have this comparison integrated with the many different version control management systems available. At that time, there was but a few commercial tools barely starting to provide basic support for collaborative work on models; and the community recognized our commitment in providing a reliable open-source stack.\r\n\r\nFive years later, both <strong>technologies and practices<\/strong> have dramatically evolved. What seemed obvious in 2006 turned out to be but one option among many others, and as time went by we have seen that the original challenges only were a subset of what we were really going to face.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with the story, from the perspective of an <strong>Eclipse commiter, contractor and tool vendor<\/strong>, of what happened during those five past years : how practices and requirements evolved, how our components adapted to these changes and has been used in practice, how we tackled collaborative modeling needs together with our adopters...\r\n\r\nWe will then move on to what is going on right now from the Eclipse side with <strong>Dawn 2.0, Mylyn and its integration with EMF\/GEF\/GMF, eGit+emf compare<\/strong>. Each leader of these efforts   (Martin Fluegge for Dawn, Benjamin Muskalla for Mylyn and Cedric Brun for EMF Compare) will demonstrate the current status of these technologies and what one can expect from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe audience will come back with <strong>our experience<\/strong> from business cases and <strong>entry points<\/strong>, given from the respective leaders of those technologies, about how one can go from concurrent access management on models to a real collaborative support.",

			"title" : "Virtual EMF \u2013 Transparent Composition, Weaving and Linking of Models",
			"abstract" : "When using the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/modeling\/emf\/\">Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)<\/a>, one frequently faces the problem of having to deal with several large heterogeneous and interrelated models. The information relevant for a specific user at a given time is often scattered across those models. Therefore, we often have the need for composing, weaving or simply linking (parts of) these models in order to provide a more unified and usable view of the modeled system(s).\r\nWith the currently available technologies, this is not a trivial task. Ideally, we would like to have a kind of <em>virtual<\/em> EMF resource offering a centralized and transparent access point to a global view on these different interconnected models. It should be implemented in a way such that:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The <em>virtual<\/em> EMF resource behaves as a normal model, so interoperability (compatibility with existing EMF-based solutions\/tools) is guaranteed;<\/li>\r\n<li>There is a perfect synchronization between the composed view (virtual resource) and the original models;<\/li>\r\n<li>Performance is not an issue, because neither creating nor accessing the global view results in additional costs (loading time, memory usage, etc.).<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAs a solution, this talk introduces the brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/a\/eclipselabs.org\/p\/virtual-emf\/\">Virtual EMF<\/a> tool which enables users to efficiently access, handle and combine a set of interrelated EMF models in a completely transparent way.\r\nTo actually illustrate the interesting capabilities provided by this EMF-based tool, we will demonstrate how this new approach is applicable to the very common problem of traceability between different models. The concrete scenario to be shown is a reverse engineering process in which several consecutive models obtained from the same Eclipse plugins source code have to be considered and treated all together.\r\nUsing the <a href=\"http:\/\/eclipse.org\/MoDisco\/\">MDT MoDisco<\/a> project, you can directly get a full representation of your Java source code as EMF models. The obtained Java models, covering everything from the package\u2019s structure to the detailed content of the methods, can be practically used for many different purposes. Still using MoDisco and related Eclipse Modeling technologies (e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/eclipse.org\/atl\/\">ATL<\/a>), these models can be transformed into several different views. For instance, three of them would be:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.eclipse.org\/MoDisco\/KDM\">KDM<\/a> model to extract the superstructure of the source code;<\/li>\r\n<li>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eclipse.org\/uml2\/\">UML2<\/a> class model to show its internal object-oriented architecture;<\/li>\r\n<li>The <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.eclipse.org\/MoDisco\/Java\">Java<\/a> model itself.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nMost likely, we would like to see the traceability relationships between these different models (e.g. while looking at the UML model, we may be interested in seeing which Java model excerpt corresponds to that specific UML element). This is particularly important when the different models may be updated during the reverse engineering process, and so may have to be synchronized accordingly.\r\nWe will use <a href=\"https:\/\/code.google.com\/a\/eclipselabs.org\/p\/virtual-emf\/\">Virtual EMF<\/a>, in this context, to implement the support for dealing transparently with all these models considering their traceability relations.\r\n",

Done manually, this involves a great deal of effort and there is currently no common test strategy for the packages. Each package is responsible for its own testing. \r\nAlthough each package is functionally different, there are some basic features that all packages have in common, for example user interface concepts and dependency handling. These basic features are ideal candidates for acceptance test automation, as the workflows are the same regardless of the package; only the data must be individualized.

He is an OpenJDK contributor from the very beginning and recently helped SAP and the SAP JVM team to engage in the OpenJDK project.\r\n\r\n<strong>Update:<\/strong> please check my recent blog about <a href=\"http:\/\/weblogs.java.net\/blog\/simonis\/archive\/2011\/10\/28\/yaojowbi-yet-another-openjdk-windows-build-instruction\">how to build a 32- and 64-bit OpenJDK 8 on WinXP\/64bit with free tools only<a>\r\n",

			"abstract" : "Did you ever broke the code or your models in your SCM? Giving the complexity of today's software systems, physical files are not the only asset in your version control system. Most of the time, complex structures are built on top of linking different files together to a logical unit. This happens in JDT with Java files the same way as EMF allows your to spread your model across different files. With this background, it easily happens that changes get mixed up or you forgot to commit\/push all necessary changes into your version control system. Also merging file contents is a task that should be handled by the plugins who understand the specific format of the files. The Eclipse Platform itself provides a  sophisticate framework to handle exactly these cases by capturing the logical state of your work and helping to commit the right set of files to your SCM and merge files when updating your working copy. In this talk, we will give a quick overview of how Logical Models can help users to handle the complexity of their systems and how plugin developers can leverage the functionality the Platform provides.\r\nAs showcase, we will use EGit which now supports the notion of logical models in combination with EMF Compare, one of the available model providers in the Eclipse ecosystem.\r\nIn addition to the demo part, we will give a quick dive into the available APIs and how other projects can enhance their capabilities with the support for Logical Models.",

And that they\u2019re willing to spend money of their own budgets to support the IT department in consequently using this methodology? No? If it\u2019s hard for you to imagine that this is really happening or if you\u2019re struggling with reservations concerning TDD in your company, then it\u2019s time to listen to this talk.\r\n\r\n<strong>In short<\/strong>\r\nMicroDoc has enhanced the TDD approach by extending the testing framework to allow reuse of automated test cases for other purposes than software testing such as self running demos, live marketing presentations, trainings and user certification.  \r\n\r\n<strong>TDD \u2013 Expensive?<\/strong>\r\nTDD methodology demands the existence of automated unit and acceptance tests within software projects. These tests are intended to run on all defined target platforms and also in simulated environments. But writing these tests leads to (initially) higher demand of resources and has negative impacts on implementation costs and amount of features in first project milestones. Positive effects of this approach are often not visible until later in the project \u2013 and savings in later phases are mostly not credited to the development budget.\r\n\r\n<strong>And now?<\/strong>\r\nHaving a software architecture with embedded Java, OSGi and Eclipse in place, which supports pluggable software running mainly unchanged on different hardware platforms and operating systems allowed MicroDoc to realize additional potentials for the investment of customers in automated test environments. Minor enhancements in the MicroDoc FitNesse Toolings for TDD showed amazing possibilities for the usage of artifacts generated within TDD, i.e.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Marketing: live presentation of complex usage scenarios \r\n<li>Customer Training: Easy way to setup reproducible application states\r\n<li>Sales: Up-to-date reality-like presentation of all variants of the current software portfolio without the need of specific target hardware \u2013 but with live usage and behavior\r\n<li>Maintenance: Tools to analyze internal system states\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>More savings<\/strong>\r\nAll artifacts are created during software development \u2013 often long time before the appropriate hardware is available. The possibility to show and use the product as a virtual device independent of the hardware leads to dramatic advantages not only regarding time lines for marketing and training but also regarding cost reduction in the area of purchase, installation and maintenance of real hardware for marketing stuff and training centers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Outlook<\/strong>\r\nThis talk will convince you that a consequent and sophisticated adoption of TDD will offer new chances for your company outreaching software quality and influencing customer acquisition, satisfaction and also customer care.\r\n\r\n",

			"abstract" : "Many experts are needed to design a spacecraft. Each of them is responsible for a specific sub system, such as power, propulsion or configuration. These subsystems have strong dependencies among each other. For example, just a small change in the spacecraft\u2019s mass can lead to a change in its size. Changing the size, however, may require a different rocket to launch the spacecraft, which in turn may not be able to reach the designated orbit. In the classical, serial design approach, all experts worked on their specific part of the problem on their own. When finished, they passed on their results to the next expert until everyone had contributed to the overall design. As a consequence, several months were needed to complete a design. \r\n\r\nToday, spacecraft design is based on concurrent engineering (CE). All subsystem experts work on their part of the problem in parallel.  Additionally, they continuously verify that their work does not conflict with the design choices by others. For this kind of cooperative work, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) operates a Concurrent Engineering Facility (CEF). At the CEF the experts meet for design sessions of typically two weeks\u2019 time. Each workplace is equipped with a computer that runs the design tools required by the corresponding subsystem. All computers share their results via a central data repository. So far, Excel used to be the standard tool for data collection and exchange. This choice, however, proved to be unsatisfactory in various ways. For example, Excel did not support the design data exchange between disciplines well. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, DLR started a software development based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. Although this platform provides little support for the specific engineering tasks  of the experts, many open source tools for concurrent and distributed work have been developed over the years, and Eclipse integrates many of them into a smooth workflow. This makes Eclipse a perfect match and baseline for the DLR design tool for space missions. The core of the new software is an EMF-based data model that serves two purposes: First, it is used as starting point for Model-Based Software Engineering, where a range of EMF-related features are very useful, such as the EMF Edit Framework and XML serialization. Second, the data model supports Model-Based System Engineering by providing semantics and consistency to the expert\u2019s data. Thus it can be reused for parameterizing further engineering tools such as simulations of the subsystems or the whole spacecraft.\r\n\r\nIn a CE session all experts use local instances of the design software. The output of each instance contributes to the common, distributed data model which is shared  by a Subversion server in the background. The details of the data exchange are hidden from the experts. They only see two functions in the user interface for \u201cupdate\u201d and \u201ccommit\u201d, which they use whenever necessary to contribute changes to the study, or to receive updates from others. As compared to the Excel-based tool, the new CEF software proved to be superior in terms of functionality, reliability and extensibility.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we give an overview of our software development, with emphasis on the data exchange among the experts. We comment on the strengths and weaknesses of Eclipse in respect of our work. \r\n",

To achieve this, in addition to thicker insulation, the algorithm used for cooling the fridge must be optimized for the configuration of the appliance. Second, Bosch-Siemens-Hausger\u00e4te manufactures a wide variety of refrigerators, and the resulting variability in the cooling algorithms has to be managed\r\nefficiently. In this session we describe the development of an Xtext-based textual DSL that addresses both of these challenges. The language supports the description of appliance configuations, as well as the cooling algorithms that run on them. The language is currently being developed at BSH, with direct involvement of the thermodynamicists who are going to use the language subsequently to capture the algorithms they come up with through\r\nexperimentation. This case in an interesting example of using Xtext, since it involves several related DSLs, a language with expressions and a type systems, an interpreter for simulating and testing the algorithms, as well as a code generator to map the algorithms to C code that will run in the actual device.",

The prime objective of BRICS is to structure and formalize the robot development process itself and to provide tools, models, and functional libraries, which help accelerating this process significantly. Two of the specific objectives of the BRICS project are the formal representation and sharing of best practices in robotics using a common DSL for component based robotic software and the software tooling to support the development and realization of such a DSL. We present the BRICS Component Model (BCM) as the core of a DSL for robotics and BRIDE as an MDE IDE for robotics.\r\n\r\nBRIDE is implemented as a set of GMF editors integrated with the CDT which provides a simple MDE solution for CBD. The GMF editors are linked to the CDT functionality by using M2M and M2T transformations from and to the BCM and a domain model of the Orocos Toolchain using the tools provided by the Epsilon project.. The Orocos Toolchain is a set portable\u00a0C++ libraries for advanced machine and robot control implemented as a component framework. The robotic development process begins with the graphical definition of a component based application which is then transformed to a C++ project with additional artifacts necessary for the execution of the code within a robotic system. We demonstrate the robotic development process using BRIDE for creating executable robotic software. We will deploy the realized software on the Kuka YouBot, a new mobile platform for research and education from KUKA. KUKA is a German company and is the third largest industrial robot manufacturer in the world and a partner in the BRICS project.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\nScreencast:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.best-of-robotics.org\/bride\/bcmdemo.html\r\n\r\nProject web site:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.best-of-robotics.org\/\r\n\r\nAlpha release site of BRIDE:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.best-of-robotics.org\/bride\r\n\r\n",

This leads to closed silos and hinders cross-team communication and collaboration. Unfortunately such infrastructures are there to stay and cannot be replaced that easily. \r\n\r\nThe new Eclipse Skalli project targets at filling this gap by providing transparency over existing projects. It enables teams to work efficiently by lowering borders to infrastructure services by providing a self-service (e.g. create your project, add an existing source code repository, add a Hudson\/Jenkins build job). With this, teams have their infrastructure services at their fingertips. Developers can search through all projects within Skalli, and will be directed to the additional project information (team members, source code repositories, build jobs).\r\n\r\nThe Skalli project provides an extensible and pluggable core, based on OSGi and Eclipse Runtime technology and a Vaadin based web interface. This can be used as a basis and be adapted to integrate into the existing enterprise development infrastructures.\r\n\r\nWe will introduce the Eclipse Skalli project, give a short demo, and share our experiences how it changed the working model within our organizations.\r\n",

That is where Xdoc comes in. Xdoc is a markup language especially designed for Eclipse Plugin documentation. The tooling that comes with Xdoc features generators for Eclipse Help plugins, Eclipse Phoenix framework based websites and printable PDF documents.\r\n\r\nThe Xdoc language was designed having several goals in mind:\r\n\r\n1. Simplicity. Flexibility in languages like Wikitext can be great, but in most cases it is not needed. It can even confuse the writers (\"Do I have to use italic or bold font here?\")\r\n2. Full separation of the document's layout from its structure. Layout is always a global issue, especially when using corporate designs like the Eclipse Nova theme, for instance.\r\n3. Validation for referenced class files. If class and\/or package names change due to refactorings, the documentation has to reflect that change.\r\n4. Support for syntax highlighting of arbitrary code chunks. When documenting DSL projects, the syntax highlighting of documented code chunks has to be definable, so it can be highlighted. Highlighting is done both, in the output files and in the Xdoc editor, so you will always get a feeling how the result will look like.\r\n5. Intuitive language design. Writing documentation is not what software developers do for fun, or do you? So the language and the tooling itself should support the developers by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk the Xdoc language and tooling will be demonstrated, focusing on useful features for code centric documentation.

Some of these solutions have indeed dramatically impacted how software is developed, while others have proved mere passing fads, never fulfilling the potential claimed for them. One of the more recent entries in this multitude is model-based software engineering (MBSE). From its emergence in the 1990s, this approach to software development along with its accompanying technologies have been promoted by advocates as game changers, promising quantum leaps in productivity and product quality. Following the initial excitement and hype generated around MBSE, its position in the limelight is now slowly fading, displaced by more recent cure-alls. While MBSE is being used in some enterprises, it is far from being the dominant software development paradigm that its proponents had hoped for. For many software professionals, its relevance and impact are unclear at best.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Bran will first examine the essential precepts of MBSE and the value proposition claimed for it. Next, in order to understand the reality behind it \u2013 as opposed to the hype -- we will review the current industry experience with MBSE, based on thorough survey of published data.

We will assume that you are already familiar with RCP and OSGi concepts so that we can focus on what has been added in Riena.\r\n\r\nTo get started quickly we will supply USB Sticks containing everything needed for Mac, Windows and Linux. We also plan to make that content available ahead of time as a download.\r\n\r\nThen we will introduce you to the basic concepts of the Riena UI and then we start to develop a Riena application step by step. The examples will already contain the domain specific code so that we can concentrate on the Riena specifics.\r\n\r\nWe will build: \r\n- the navigation tree \r\n- wire it with RCP views \r\n- show you how to use Ridgets and how MVC works in Riena \r\n- show the use of navigation and jump in Riena \r\n- show the advantages of UI Processes \r\n- consume the results of Remote Services that are based on OSGi Services\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop we not only supply software but also a PDF with a detailed description of the workshop (so in case you get lost, you can catch up).\r\n\r\nAttendees should be familiar with Eclipse RCP and Equinox.",
